Game idea {
- the player has a lot of weapons
- possible pvp
- when player dies, he drops 10% of his eq
- building system: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnGHhFBSm_A (from Rust)
- player can build some buildings, eg. houses, in which he'll be safe (there the enemies won't be able to attack him)
- every building can be destroyed by anyone
- every player has his own cuboid on server, they are made up of symetrically divided terrain
- player can earn money by selling things to the shop, eg. wood logs, found in the forest sticks, rocks, diamonds etc.
- the players create the shop's assortment; to buy something one player has to sell one thing, and then the other player can buy this thing. The shop will add to the price its commision, which will be collected by the shop owner, which is a player.
- for the money the player will can buy weapon upgrades, armor, things in the shop, lend a tool (fe. axe)
- There would be some add. game modes like battle royale, deathmatches, challenges, adversary modes (from GTA). Players could invite their friends to these actions).
- The jobs system idea:
	When a player starts the game, he has to start a work, to stay alive. He choses a job, eg. logger. He receives the business axe for the work time (without any possible upgrades, no use of it after work). Game idea:

- The jobs system idea:
	When a player starts the game, he has to start a work, to stay alive. He choses a job, eg. logger and starts a paid internship. He receives the business axe for the work time (without any possible upgrades, no use of it after work). He gets tasks to do from the boss. He has to achieve a specific count of completed tasks. If he decides to change the job and didn't achieve that number, his progress is lost. But if he continues the same job and achieves that count of completed tasks, he completes the internship and receives the logger licence, which makes him able to buy his own axe and be hired as a logger. Now he can leave the company with the licence and come back to be hired in this company in any moment of the game. If he wants to be employed, he has to sign a contract with the company. When he starts the work in the company, his salary becomes the same as it was when he finished the internship (even though he worked there before). The salary = base + commision for every cut and delivered tree to the customer.
